				<h1>Dragons</h1>
				<p>
					Dragons are perhaps the most well known of the mythical creatures. Appearing in European, East Asian, and other lore around the world, and with appearances on almost every continent, dragons have remained a symbol of power, wisdom, and destruction throughout the ages. Western dragons usually stand on both legs and spit fire. They are also more temperamental. Eastern dragons have more serpentlike bodies and are calm.

						primordial creation, depicted as a woman, she represents the beauty of the<br> 
						feminine, depicted as the glistening one. It is suggested that there are two<br> 
						parts to the Tiamat mythos, the first in which Tiamat is a creator goddess,<br> 
						through a "Sacred marriage" between salt and fresh water, peacefully<br> 
						creating the cosmos through successive generations. In the second<br> 
						"Chaoskampf" Tiamat is considered the monstrous embodiment of primordial<br>

						The roc (from Persian Rokh or Rukh) is an enormous legendary bird of prey.<br>  
						The roc appears in Arabic geographies and natural history, popularized<br>

					<div id="ziz" class="img_des">
						The Ziz is a giant griffin-like bird in Jewish mythology, said to be large<br>  
						enough to be able to block out the sun with its wingspan. It is considered a<br>  
						giant animal/monster corresponding to archetypal creatures. Rabbis have<br>  
						said that the Ziz is comparable to the Persian Simurgh, while modern scholars<br>  
						compare the Ziz to the Sumerian Anzu and the Ancient Greek phoenix.
					</div>
					<div id="phoenix" class="img_des">
						In Greek mythology, a phoenix is a long-lived bird that is cyclically<br>  
						regenerated or reborn. Associated with the sun, a phoenix obtains new<br>  
						life by arising from the ashes of its predecessor. According to some sources,<br>  
						the phoenix dies in a show of flames and combustion, although there are<br>  
						other sources that claim that the  legendary bird dies and simply<br>  
						decomposes before being born again. According to some texts, the phoenix<br>  
						could live over 1,400 years before rebirth.

					<div id="thunderbird" class="img_des">
						The thunderbird is a legendary creature in certain North American<br>  
						indigenous peoples' history and culture. It is considered a supernatural<br>  
						bird of power and strength. It is especially important, and frequently<br>

						Coast cultures, and is found in various forms among the peoples of the<br>  
						American Southwest, Great Lakes, and Great Plains.
					</div>
					<div id="valravn" class="img_des">
						In Danish folklore, a valravn (Danish "raven of the slain") is a supernatural raven.<br>  
						The ravens appear in traditional Danish folksongs, where they are described as<br>  
						originating from ravens who consume the bodies of the dead on the battlefield, as<br>  
						capable of turning into the form of a knight after consuming the heart of a child,<br>  
						and, alternately, as half-wolf and half-raven creatures.
					</div>
					<div id="harpy" class="img_des">
						In Greek mythology and Roman mythology, a harpy was a female monster<br>  
						in the form  of a bird with a human face. They steal food from their victims<br>  
						while they are eating and carry evildoers (especially those who have killed<br>  
						their family) to the Erinyes. They seem originally to have been wind spirits.<br>  
						Their name means "snatchers".

					<div id="garuda" class="img_des">
						The Garuda is a large bird-like creature, or humanoid bird that appears in both<br>  
						Hinduism and Buddhism. Garuda is the mount (vahana) of the Lord Vishnu.<br>  Garuda is the Hindu name for the constellation Aquila. The<br>  
						brahminy kite and phoenix are considered to be the contemporary representations<br>  
						of Garuda. Indonesia adoptsa more stylistic approach to the Garuda's<br>  
						depiction as its national symbol, where it depicts a Javanese eagle (being<br>  
						much larger than a kite)

					<div id="anzu" class="img_des">
						Anz√ª, also known as Imdugud, is a lesser divinity or monster in several<br>

				<h1>Beasts</h1>
				<p>
					There are many types of beasts, some with traits from several animals. From the griffin to the manticore and sphinx, these beasts are powerful and yet also are noble. Many of them also have wings, but cannot fly as high or as fast as their avian brethren. They are stronger though, and can also run on the ground if need be.

					<div id="griffin" class="img_des">
						The griffin, griffon, or gryphon is a legendary creature with the body, tail,<br>  
						and back legs of a lion; the head and wings of an eagle; and an eagle's talons as<br>  
						its front feet. Because the lion was traditionally considered the king of the<br>  
						beasts and the eagle the king of birds, the griffin was thought to be an especially<br>  
						powerful and majestic creature. The griffin was also thought of as king of all<br>  
						creatures. Griffins are known for guarding treasure and priceless possessions.
					</div>
					<div id="manticore" class="img_des">
						The manticore (Early Middle Persian Martyaxwar) is a Persian legendary creature<br>  
						similar to the Egyptian sphinx. It has the body of a red lion, a human head with<br>  
						three rows of sharp teeth (like a shark), sometimes bat-like wings, and a<br>  
						trumpet-like voice. Other aspects of the creature vary from story to story.<br>  
						It may be horned, winged, or both. The tail is that of either a dragon or a scorpion,<br>  
						and it may shoot venomous spines to either paralyze or kill its victims. It devours<br>  
						its prey whole and leaves no clothes, bones, or possessions of the prey behind.
					</div>
					<div id="chimera" class="img_des">
						The Chimera was, according to Greek mythology, a monstrous fire-breathing<br>  
						hybrid creature of Lycia in Asia Minor, composed of the parts of more<br>  
						than one animal. Usually depicted as a lion, with the head of a goat<br>  
						arising from its back, and a tail that might end with a snake's head,<br>  
						the Chimera was one of the offspring of Typhon and Echidna and a sibling<br>  
						of such monsters as Cerberus and the Lernaean Hydra.
					</div>
					<div id="hippogriff" class="img_des">
						The hippogriff, or sometimes hippogryph is a legendary creature which has<br>  
						the front quarters of an eagle and the hind quarters of a horse. The first<br>  
						recorded mention of the hippogriff was made by the Latin poet Virgil in<br>  
						his Eclogues. Though sometimes depicted during the Classical Era and<br>  
						during the rule of the Merovingians, it was used Ludovico Ariosto<br>  
						in his Orlando Furioso, at the beginning of the 16th century. Within<br>  
						the poem, the hippogriff is a steed born of a mare and a griffin - it is<br>  
						extremely fast and is presented as being able to fly around the world and<br>  
						to the moon. It is ridden by magicians and the wandering knight Ruggiero,<br>  
						who, from the creature‚Äôs back, frees the beautiful Angelica.
					</div>
					<div id="cerberus" class="img_des">
						Cerberus in Greek and Roman mythology, is a multi-headed (usually<br>  
						three-headed) dog, or "hellhound" with a serpent's tail, a mane of snakes,<br>  
						and a lion's claws. He guards the entrance of the Greek underworld<br>  
						to prevent the dead from escaping and the living from entering. Cerberus is<br>  
						featured in many works of ancient Greek and Roman literature and in works of<br>  
						both ancient and modern art and architecture, although the depiction<br>  
						of Cerberus differs across various renditions. The most notable difference<br>  
						is the number of his heads: Most sources describe or depict three heads;<br>  
						others show Cerberus with two or even just one; a smaller number of sources<br>  
						show a variable number, sometimes as many as fifty or even a hundred.
					</div>
					<div id="sphinx" class="img_des">
						A sphinx is a mythical creature with, as a minimum, the head of a human and<br>  
						the body of a lion. In Greek tradition, it has the head of a human, the<br>  
						haunches of a lion, and sometimes the wings of a bird. It is mythicised<br>  
						as treacherous and merciless. Those who cannot answer its riddle suffer a<br>  
						fate typical in such mythological stories, as they are killed and eaten<br>  
						by this ravenous monster. This deadly version of a sphinx appears in<br>  
						the myth and drama of Oedipus. Unlike the Greek sphinx, which was a woman,<br>  
						the Egyptian sphinx is typically shown as a man (an androsphinx). In addition,<br>  
						the Egyptian sphinx was viewed as benevolent, but having a ferocious<br>  
						strength similar to the malevolent Greek version and both were thought of<br>  
						as guardians often flanking the entrances to temples.
					</div>
					<div id="pegasus" class="img_des">
						Pegasus (Ancient Greek: Pegasos; Latin: Pegasus) is one of<br>  
						the best known creatures in Greek mythology. He is a winged divine<br>  
						stallion usually depicted as pure white in color. He was sired by<br>  
						Poseidon, in his role as horse-god, and foaled by the Gorgon Medusa.<br>  
						He was the brother of Chrysaor, born at a single birthing when his<br>  
						mother was decapitated by Perseus. Greco-Roman poets write about his<br>  
						ascent to heaven after his birth and his obeisance to Zeus, king of the<br>  
						gods, who instructed him to bring lightning and thunder from Olympus.
					</div>
					<div id="fenrir" class="img_des">
						In Norse mythology, Fenrir (Old Norse: "fen-dweller"), Fenrisulfr<br>  
						(Old Norse: "Fenris wolf"), Hro&eth;vitnir (Old Norse: "fame-wolf"), or<br>  
						Vanagandr (Old Norse: "the monster of the river Van") is a monstrous<br>  
						wolf. Fenrir is attested in the Poetic Edda, compiled in the 13th century<br>  
						from earlier traditional sources, and the Prose Edda and Heimskringla,<br>  
						written in the 13th century by Snorri Sturluson. In both the Poetic Edda<br>  
						and Prose Edda, Fenrir is the father of the wolves Skoll and Hati<br>  
						Hro&eth;vitnisson, is a son of Loki, and is foretold to kill the god Odin<br>  
						during the events of Ragnarok, but will in turn be killed by Odin's son<br>  
						Vi&eth;arr.

				<h1>Sea Creatures</h1>
				<p>
					The sea holds many untold marvels. Since humanity began its attempts to tame the sea, it has faced these creatures of the deep. They are very elusive but when roused from their slumber, it could spell doom. Sea creatures usually can swim very far without needing to come up for air. They require lots of water and room to freely move about.

					<div id="leviathan" class="img_des">
						Leviathan is a sea monster referenced in the Tanakh, or the Old Testament.<br>  
						The word has become synonymous with any large sea monster or creature.<br>

						whales, and in Modern Hebrew, it simply means "whale". It is described<br>

						some small islands called Sirenum scopuli. In some later, <br>

					<div id="kraken" class="img_des">
						The Kraken is a legendary sea monster of large proportions that is said<br>

						in length 12 to 15 meters(40 to 50 feet) including the tentacles. The<br>  
						sheer size and fearsome appearance attributed to the kraken have made it<br>

					<div id="bahamut" class="img_des">
						Bahamut or Bahamoot is a vast fish that supports the earth in Arabian<br>

						is a giant fish acting as one of the layers that supports the earth.<br>  
						In Jorge Luis Borges' Book of Imaginary Beings, Bahamut is "altered<br>  
						and magnified" from Behemoth, and described as so immense that a human<br>  
						cannot bear its sight; "[all] the seas of the world, placed in one of<br>  
						the fish's nostrils, would be like a mustard seed laid in the desert."
					</div>
					<div id="cetus" class="img_des">
						In Ancient Greek, the word ketos, Latinized as cetus, denotes a large fish,<br>  
						a whale, a shark, or a sea monster. The sea monsters slain by Perseus<br>  
						and Heracles were each referred to as a cetus by ancient sources.The term<br>  
						cetacean (for whale) originates from cetus. In Greek art, cetea were<br>

						In medieval Jewish folklore, Rahab (noise, tumult, arrogance) is a mythical<br>

						In European bestiaries and legends, a basilisk  is a legendary reptile<br> 
						reputed to be king of serpents and said to have the power to cause<br> 
						death with a single glance. According to the Naturalis Historia of Pliny<br> 
						the Elder, the basilisk of Cyrene is a small snake, "being not more<br> 
						than twelve fingers in length," that is so venomous, it leaves a wide<br> 
						trail of deadly venom in its wake, and its gaze is likewise lethal;<br> 
						its weakness is in the odor of the weasel, which, according to Pliny,<br> 
						was thrown into the basilisk's hole, recognizable because all the<br> 
						surrounding shrubs and grass had been scorched by its presence. It is<br> 
						possible that the legend of the basilisk and its association with<br> 
						the weasel in Europe was inspired by accounts of certain species of<br> 
						Asiatic snakes (such as the king cobra) and their natural predator,<br> 
						the mongoose.

					<div id="naga" class="img_des">
						Naga is the Sanskrit and Pali word for a deity or class of entity<br>

						The beast of the sea is pictured with crowns on its horns, which are not<br> 
						present on the scarlet beast. The scarlet beast is shown being ridden<br>  
						by a harlot who "reigns over the kings of the earth", (Revelation<br>  
						17:18) whereas the beast of the sea is not being ridden, and is given<br>  
						"power...and great authority." The seven heads of the beast represent<br>  
						both seven mountains and seven kings, and the ten horns are ten kings<br>  
						who have not yet received kingdoms. Of the seven kings we are told<br>  
						that five have fallen, one is, the other has not yet come. We are<br>  
						also told that the beast itself is an eighth king who is "of the seven",<br>  
						and is going to perdition. We are also told that this beast "was,<br>  
						and is not; and shall ascend out of the bottomless pit, and go into<br>  
						perdition."
