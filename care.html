				We started this business 20 years ago our of a desire of both to have these creatures as our friends and as a way to create a stronger bond between us and nature. While in ancient times these beasts were feared and hated, in the modern world, these beasts are well liked and have become favorites with many people. It is important to gather and tame these creatures with love and care, both for the safety of the creature and for the handler. We make sure all of our beasts are in good condition and well trained before we sell them, and we know that our history of good ratings shows our pedigree.

Known as monsters and destructive beasts, we have now come to apreciate their wild natures and are able keep them as friends. Our pets are the most well known of the mythological creatures, but we also have lesser known creatures that nonetheless make equally good pets. Some of them have lived for decades; others for centuries. Most of them are highly intelligent and some can even speak human language! A lot of them can fly and several are capable of underwater exploration. The ground ones can outrun racing cars and can even compete against bullet trains. Some of them are human sized while others are as large as cars. But above all, they are all happy to be taken care of.
